# British-Airways
In the British Airways project, we downloaded customer reviews from Skytrax using the Python package Beautifulsoup.Approximately 1,000 reviews from the website of British Airways.Once we downloaded the reviews we needed to perform data cleaning to do the process of Natural Language Processing for the sentiment analysis of whether the customer review is positive or negative.
